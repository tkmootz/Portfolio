--Query 1: joining tables and creating temp tables for data to be queried in Tableau or PowerBI

--Create temp table and union all tables
WITH hotels AS (
SELECT * FROM dbo.['2018$']
UNION
SELECT * FROM dbo.['2018$']
UNION
SELECT * FROM dbo.['2020$'])

--Store temp table into new table, preparing for joins
SELECT *
INTO hotel_data
FROM hotels

--Join market segment table
SELECT * FROM hotel_data
LEFT JOIN dbo.market_segment$
ON hotel_data.market_segment = dbo.market_segment$.market_segment

--Join meal cost table
LEFT JOIN dbo.meal_cost$
ON hotel_data.meal = dbo.meal_cost$.meal


--Query 2: data exploration and finding KPIs

--Average daily rate of all rooms, by hotel type
SELECT ROUND(AVG(adr),2) AS average_daily_rate, hotel
FROM hotel_data
GROUP BY hotel

--Finding profit after accounting for ADR and customer discount rates
SELECT h.arrival_date_year, h.hotel, SUM(h.stays_in_weekend_nights + h.stays_in_week_nights)*h.adr - SUM(h.stays_in_weekend_nights + h.stays_in_week_nights)*m.Discount AS profit
FROM hotel_data h, market_segment$ m
LEFT JOIN market_segment$
ON m.market_segment = hotel_data.market_segment
GROUP BY 1, 2
