# Portfolio

This portfolio is meant to show my skills in SQL queries and dashboard building. I am also certified with Alteryx, however it is more difficult to show my workflows that I've built
in that program. I will be uploading files from Alteryx in the future.

Please feel free to look over my queries. The data are all static files, so unfortunately I do not get as many opportunities to also show my dedication to building queries that
are best suited for dynamic data sources.
